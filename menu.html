                Organic farming is a farming practice that doesn't use synthetic inputs like pesticides and fertilizers. Instead, it uses traditional inputs like: Green manure, Compost manure, Crop rotation, Biological pest control, Intercropping.<br>
            Organic farming also: <br>
            &nbsp;1.&nbsp;Uses biological fertilizers and pest control from animal or plant waste<br>
            &nbsp;2.&nbsp;Strives for sustainability<br>
            &nbsp;3.&nbsp;Enhances soil fertility and biological diversity<br>
            &nbsp;4.&nbsp;Prohibits synthetic pesticides, antibiotics, synthetic fertilizers, genetically modified organisms, and growth hormones<br>
            Organic farming was started as a response to the environmental problems caused by chemical pesticides and synthetic fertilizers. The British botanist Sir Albert Howard is often called the father of modern organic agriculture. <br>
            Organic farming has some benefits, like: <br>
            &nbsp;1.&nbsp;Ecological benefits<br>
            &nbsp;2.&nbsp;Higher food costs<br>
            &nbsp;3.&nbsp;Generally lower yields

                Agroforestry is a land management system that combines agriculture and forestry. It involves growing trees or shrubs around or among crops or pastureland.<br>

    Other benefits of agroforestry<br> 
    &nbsp;1.&nbsp;It's a practical and low-cost means of implementing many forms of integrated land management.<br>
    &nbsp;2.&nbsp;It can help build resilience to climate change.<br>
    &nbsp;3.&nbsp;It can help governments, non-governmental organizations, and farmers expand the scale of agroforestry for food security and climate.<br>
    The oldest known agroforestry practice <br>

                Crop rotation is the practice of growing different crops in the same area over a series of growing seasons. The goal of crop rotation is to:<br> 
    &nbsp;1.&nbsp;Manage soil fertility<br>
    &nbsp;2.&nbsp;Avoid or reduce problems with soil-borne diseases and some soil-dwelling insects<br>
    &nbsp;3.&nbsp;Improve soil health<br>
    &nbsp;4.&nbsp;Optimize nutrients in the soil<br>
    &nbsp;5.&nbsp;Combat pest and weed pressure<br>
    Crop rotation reduces the reliance of crops on one set of nutrients, pest and weed pressure, and the probability of developing resistant pests and weeds. It's the opposite of continuous cropping, which is growing the same crop in the same field year after year. <br>
    Ideally, crops in a rotation are not of the same family. For example, legumes are useful in crop rotation because they have nodulated roots that harbor nitrogen fixing Rhizobium bacteria. When the roots are left over in fields and only aerial parts of legume crops are harvested, it leaves more nitrates in the soil. <br>

              <p>Permaculture is a sustainable agricultural system that mimics natural ecosystems. It aims to reduce waste, prevent pollution, and improve biodiversity.<br>
                The term "permaculture" was coined in 1978 by Bill Mollison and David Holmgren. They formulated the concept in opposition to modern industrialized methods.<br>

                What is aquaculture? <br>
                &nbsp;1.&nbsp;Breeding, growing, and harvesting: Aquaculture involves breeding, raising, and harvesting aquatic organisms in water.<br>
                &nbsp;2.&nbsp;Environmentally responsible: Aquaculture can help to create healthier habitats and rebuild populations of endangered species.<br>
                &nbsp;3.&nbsp;Human consumption: Aquaculture businesses prepare plants and animals for human consumption.<br>
                Risks of aquaculture :<br>
                &nbsp;1.&nbsp; Disease transmission: Disease can be transmitted between farmed and wild fish.<br>
                &nbsp;2.&nbsp;Pathogens and parasites: Nonnative pathogens and parasites can be introduced when fish are transported.<br>
                Asia is the largest aquaculture producer In 2017, Asia accounted for 92% of the live-weight volume of animals and seaweeds. </p>

                Hydroponics is a method of growing plants without soil. Instead, plants are grown in a nutrient-rich solution that contains a mixture of basic, secondary, and micro-nutrients. The roots of the plants are supported by substances such as peat moss, clay pellets, perlite, and rockwool. <br>
      Benefits of hydroponics <br>
      &nbsp;1.&nbsp;Uses less water than traditional soil-based systems<br>
      &nbsp;2.&nbsp;Allows for faster growth and higher yields than traditional soil-based growing systems<br>
      &nbsp;3.&nbsp;Can grow hydroponically all year long<br>
      Challenges of hydroponics :<br>
      &nbsp;1.&nbsp;There is a steep learning curve<br>
      &nbsp;2.&nbsp;Small errors can affect the whole crop<br>
      &nbsp;3.&nbsp;The systems are very vulnerable to equipment failure or power outage, which can kill the plants within a few hours<br>

              <p>Contour ploughing is a farming technique that involves following the natural contours of the land when tilling, planting, and cultivating. It helps to prevent soil erosion by slowing down the flow of water and preventing it from washing away topsoil. <br>
